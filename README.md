# javascript_User-Search_IGTI

JavaScript implementation of a search for users with an API request. Executed during the IGTI Full Stack Development course.

The data is fictitious and was obtained from the public API [Ramdom User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) (a sample of data was saved locally to avoid many requests).

We also use [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/) to minimally style the front-end.
